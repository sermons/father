For you remember, brothers, <br/>
our **labor** and **toil**: <br/>
we worked **night** and **day**,<br/>
that we might not be a **burden** to any of you,<br/>
while we **proclaimed** to you the gospel of God.

You are **witnesses**, and God also, <br/>
how **holy** and **righteous** and **blameless** <br/>
was our **conduct** toward you believers.

For you know how, <br/>
like a **father** with his children, <br/>
<span class="ref">12</span>
we **exhorted** each one of you <br/>
and **encouraged** you and **charged** you <br/>
to **walk** in a manner worthy of God, <br/>
who **calls** you into his own kingdom and glory.
