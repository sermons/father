while we **proclaimed** to you the gospel of God.

You are **witnesses**, and God also, <br/>
how **holy** and **righteous** and **blameless** <br/>
was our **conduct** toward you believers.

For you know how, <br/>
like a **father** with his children,

and **encouraged** you and **charged** you

to **walk** in a manner worthy of God, <br/>
who **calls** you into his own kingdom and glory.
